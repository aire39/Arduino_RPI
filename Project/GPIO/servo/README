There is 2 ways to handle the servos.

1) Pulse
-- Not too hard to deal with but would need to create a buffer as I would need
to continually send it the correct pulse through a loop of some sort

2) PWM which is only available on GPIO18 (pin 12).
-- I bought an extender for more PWM control so I should have more than 1 though it needs setup. I can more easily send the angle through the PWM signal.
