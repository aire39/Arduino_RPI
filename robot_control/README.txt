Group project
=========================

The project was to remotely control a 4 wheel robot. This used the Arduino Uno V3.

Hardware:
Arduino Uno (Firmware needed to be updated as there were issues with functions not correctly working)
Motor Shield
Wifi Shield (Wifi pins caused signals from motor shield to be blocked)

Used Android Phones to remotely control the robot.

Features:

Basic movement control
-Forward
-Left/Right turn
-Reverse

What did I work on:

-Arduino: hardware coding. Set server to get signals from IP.
-Android: adding the record feature
-Trouble Shooting Hardware and Software.

This is the complete code for the project.
